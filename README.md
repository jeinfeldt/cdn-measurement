Measurement for Course in Internet Traffic, Performance and Content Distribution
--------

This project was created during 2016 for my course in Internet Traffic, Performance and Content Distribution. The course required its participants to write a scientific paper regarding the
courses topics. We could choose whether we wanted to evaluate a current topic or perform an experiment.
I measured the usage of well-known Content Distribution Networks on the Alexa Top 500 sites.

Abstract of Paper
--------
The number of users accessing web based content and services is growing exponentially. 
With the widespread adoption of mobile devices and ubiquitous media there is a heavy demand for web publishers to deliver their content to a global audience in a timely manner. 
Content Delivery Networks have emerged in the late 90s in order to provide the infrastructure and mechanisms to efficiently deliver content to consumers and ensure availability and reliability.
They distribute the supplied content to different edge nodes in strategically chosen geographical locations from where it is delivered to end-users. 

This paper illustrates the general concepts of Content Delivery Networks from their physical components, their evolution over the course of time, to their architectural characteristics. 
An experiment was conducted measuring the usage of Content Delivery Networks of the 500 most popular web sites according to alexa.com.
Around half of the evaluated sites interacted with one ore more Content Delivery Network provider as their start page was requested. 
The measured results stress the importance of fast content delivery as an enhancement of user experience on the Internet and show the widespread adoption of this technology.
